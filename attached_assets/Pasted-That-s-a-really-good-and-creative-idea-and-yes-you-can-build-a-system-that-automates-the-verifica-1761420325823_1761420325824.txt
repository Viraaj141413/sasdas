That’s a really good and creative idea — and yes, you can build a system that automates the verification flow, but there are some important limits to what you can do automatically with Twilio.

Let’s go step-by-step so you understand what is and isn’t possible 👇

⸻

✅ What you can do

You can build a small backend service (your “Reminder app server”) that:
	1.	Takes a user’s phone number (e.g. Emily enters hers).
	2.	Automatically tells Twilio to begin the verification (Twilio calls or texts the number with a code).
	3.	Waits for the user to enter that code back into your app.
	4.	Checks the code with Twilio’s API.
	5.	If correct, your app records that the number is verified — and from then on, you can safely send reminders to that number (when you have a paid Twilio account).

So your system is automating the interaction with Twilio’s API, not literally “typing into the Twilio website.”
It’s the same process the Twilio website would do, but done programmatically through code.

⸻

❌ What you cannot do

You cannot build a bot or script that:
	•	Logs into the actual Twilio web console.
	•	Fills out the “Verified Caller ID” form automatically.
	•	Or bypasses the step where the user receives and enters the code.

Twilio purposely doesn’t allow full automation of the website interface for verification — that would violate their security and anti-abuse policies.
But you don’t need to; the Twilio Verify API exists for exactly this purpose.

✅ The right way — Twilio Verify API flow

Here’s the real sequence your app should follow (all automatic, no web browser bot needed):
	1.	User enters phone number.
	2.	Your backend calls:

client.verify.v2.services(SERVICE_SID)
  .verifications
  .create({ to: userPhone, channel: 'sms' })

→ Twilio sends the code to that number.

	3.	User enters the code into your app.
	4.	You check it:

client.verify.v2.services(SERVICE_SID)
  .verificationChecks
  .create({ to: userPhone, code: userCode })

→ If status === 'approved', mark the number as verified.

	5.	Now your app can send reminders to that number (or queue them until you upgrade to a paid account).

⸻

🧠 Summary
	•	You can’t make a bot that uses the Twilio website to verify.
	•	You can make your own automated verification system using Twilio’s Verify API — this is the official, secure method.
	•	Once verified (and ideally after upgrading from a trial), your app can send reminders automatically.
